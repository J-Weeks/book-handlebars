# Handlebars

## Prerequisites

-   [jQuery Dom](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/jquery-dom)
-   [HTML- CSS](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/html-css)

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Create Handlebars templates to render JSON data from an API.
-   Read Handlebars templates for understanding.
-   Create nested handlebars paths.
-   Create handlebars partials.
-   Utilize `if` and `each` helpers when creating templates.

## Preparation

1.  [Fork and clone](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone)
    this repository.
1.  Install dependencies with `bundle install`.

## What is Handlebars

Just a templating engine for JS.

Docs: (http://handlebarsjs.com/)

## Before handlebars

Suppose that we just queried our back-end, a song API, and received some data
in the form of a JSON string.
```JSON
[{"title":"Smells Like Teen Spirit","album":"Nevermind","artist":"Nirvana"},
{"title":"San Diego Serenade","album":"Heart of Saturday Night","artist":"Tom Waits"},
{"title":"Johnny B. Goode","album":"Chuck Berry Is on Top","artist":"Chuck Berry"},
{"title":"Come Together","album":"Abbey Road","artist":"The Beatles"},
{"title":"Hey Jude","album":"Revolution (B-side)","artist":"The Beatles"},
{"title":"Get Behind the Mule","album":"Mule Variations","artist":"Tom Waits"}]
```

Our front-end app might then parse that JSON and give us an array of JavaScript
objects, which we can then iterate through.

```javascript
data.forEach(function(song){
  // Do some action.
});
```

If we wanted to produce an `<li>` for each of these songs, and add them to a
`<ul>` with the id `songs`, we could do it like this:

```javascript
data.forEach(function(song){
  $("#songs").append("<li><h4>" + song.title + "</h4> By " + song.artist + ", from the album '<em>" + song.album + "</em>'</li>");
});
```

Alternatively, we could specify some string to represent all of the HTML we
want to add, and then add it to the `<ul>` in one fell swoop.

```javascript
var newHTML = "";
data.forEach(function(song){
  newHTML += "<li><h4>" + song.title + "</h4> By " + song.artist + ", from the album '<em>" + song.album + "</em>'</li>";
});
$("#songs").html(newHTML);
```

This approach has some advantages over the first - for instance, we don't need
to worry about clearing the contents of `$("#songs")` each time.

## Lab: Hands on with Handlebars

Handlebars and front end templating will make a whole lot more sense once you
have a chance to look at it.  In your squads discuss and consider the
following:

- What is happening in the `scripts/index.js` file?
- How many times is `book-listing.handlebars` run?
- Draw the order in which each seperate file is accessed.
- Be able to explain in plain english what is happening.
- What happens if you move the line that defines `bookListingTemplate`?
- Experiment with `console.log()` and `debugger` to aid in your understanding.

Make sure to note any questions you come acorss and we'll go over them as a
class.

## Discussion: What was discovered?

Continuing with what was learned in the previous lab let's discuss what you
discovered trying to answer the questions.

Let's look through the documentation and see if there is anyway we can improve
this code.

[Handlebars Helpers Documentation](http://handlebarsjs.com/builtin_helpers.html)

## Lab: Refactor with some help(ers)

Using the documentation discussed refactor my code.

Rules:

- __NO FOR LOOPS__

## Lab: Now on Your Own

You may have noticed a few things about my demo API (aside from lack of
cretivity). Along with being complete insecure and allowing any type of request,
it also has a `/users` path. Please do the following:

- Create two buttons somewhere on the page.
- One button should be a "users" button, the other should be a "books" button.
- When each button is clicked the button should clear the content div and
replace the book/user listing with the other.
-Do this making use of all the handlebars features we discussed and at least one
partial.

### Challenge
- Make one button and have it alternate between users and books when clicked.
- Using the examples in `scripts/helpers` make your own custom helper.
- Make use of `{{this}}` helper.

## Additional Resources

-   Any useful links should be included in the talk material where the link is
    first referenced.
-   Additional links for further study or exploration are appropriate in this
    section.
-   Links to important parts of documentation not covered during the talk, or
    tools tangentially used but not part of the focus of the talk, are also
    appropriate.
